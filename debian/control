Description: Blackfriday: a markdown processor for Go
 Blackfriday is a Markdown processor implemented in Go. It is paranoid about its
 input (so you can safely feed it user-supplied data), it is fast, it supports
 common extensions (tables, smart punctuation substitutions, etc.), and it is
 safe for all utf-8 (unicode) input.
 .
 HTML output is currently supported, along with Smartypants extensions. An
 experimental LaTeX output engine is also included.
 .
 It started as a translation from C of upskirt.
 .
 This package contains the source.
